# Project Title

A modern, responsive news application built with React and Vite.

## Overview

This project is a frontend application built using React and Vite. It displays news content using a modular, component-based architecture. The application is organized with clear separation of concerns, featuring components such as Header, Footer, Loader, and NewsCards (with individual NewsCard components) to provide a scalable and maintainable codebase. Fast development and optimized builds are achieved through Vite's advanced tooling.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Clean UI components designed for various devices.
- **News Display:** Showcases news articles using reusable card components.
- **Fast Development:** Powered by Vite for quick hot-reloading and efficient bundling.
- **Modular Codebase:** Organized into components for ease of maintenance.
- **ESLint Integration:** Ensures code quality and consistency throughout the project.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Library for building the user interface.
- **Vite:** Build tool that provides a fast development environment.
- **JavaScript/JSX:** Core language for application logic and UI components.
- **CSS:** Styling for components.
- **ESLint:** Code linting tool to maintain code quality.
